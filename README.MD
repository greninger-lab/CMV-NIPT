# Highly fragmented cytomegalovirus nucleic acid in maternal cfDNA

## Congenital CMV is one of the most common causes of birth defects yet is not screened for in the United States.
CMV is the leading cause of newborn deafness via congenital infections. Despite this, it is unscreened for in routine prenatal screenings. The current 'gold standard' of congenital CMV diagnostics PCR on amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is an invasive procedure with a non-zero risk of complications occurring. 

## Can we detect CMV in NIPT cell-free DNA sequencing samples?
Our goal is to detect CMV in cfDNA sequence from the serum of pregnant mothers. Here, we use pre-existing maternal cell-free DNA sequence to find CMV sequence in this data and evaluate it as a method of diagnosing congenital CMV infections.

## We aligned cell-free DNA sequence to the CMV Merlin reference genome and extracted blast-verified CMV reads
