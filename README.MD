# Looking for Cytomegaloviurs in cfDNA sequnece from a pregnant mother cohort
## Why CMV? 
CMV is the leading cause of newborn deafness via congenital infections. Despite this, it is unscreened for in routine prenatal screenigns. The current 'gold standard' of congenital CMV diagnostics PCR on amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is an invasive procedure with a non-zero risk of complication. Our goal is to detect CMV in cfDNA sequence from the serum of pregnant mothers. This data is already being created by the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine, Genetics, for aneuploidy screening. Here, we attempt to find CMV sequence in this data and evaluate it as a method of diagnosing congenital CMV infections.
### Project goals:   
 See if we can detect CMV in cfDNA sequence 
 If so, is the circulating fragment length of CMV different than that of human?
